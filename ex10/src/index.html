                <p>This is a book about instructing computers. Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today,
                    but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t always
                    easy.</p>

                <li><strong>On programming</strong>
                    <p>Besides explaining JavaScript, I will introduce the basic principles of programming.
                        Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but programs
                        built on top of these rules tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and
                        complexity. You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you might just get lost in it.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Why language matters</strong>
                    <p>In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming languages. Programs
                        looked something like this:</p><code>00110001 00000000 00000000 <br>
                                00110001 00000001 00000001<br>
                                00110011 00000001 00000010<br>
                                01010001 00001011 00000010<br>
                                00100010 00000010 00001000<br>
                                01000011 00000001 00000000<br>
                                01000001 00000001 00000001<br>

                <p>Inside the computer’s world, there is only data. You can read data, modify data, create new
                    data—but that which isn’t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of
                    bits and is thus fundamentally alike.</p>

                    In this chapter, we will start to do things that can actually be called programming. We will
                    expand our command of the JavaScript language beyond the nouns and sentence fragments we’ve seen
                    so far, to the point where we can express meaningful prose.

                    <li><strong>Bindings</strong>
                        <p>How does a program keep an internal state? How does it remember things? We have seen how
                            to produce new values from old values, but this does not change the old values, and the
                            new value has to be immediately used or it will dissipate again. To catch and hold
                            values, JavaScript provides a thing called a binding, or variable:</p>

            <article>
                <p>Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece of
                    program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce
                    repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each
                    other.</p>
                <code>
                            const square = function(x) {<br>
                                return x * x;<br>
                              };<br>
                              <br>
                              console.log(square(12));<br>
                              // → 144

                <p>Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms that data structures are built from. Many types of
                    information require more than one atom, though. Objects allow us to group values—including other
                    objects—to build more complex structures.</p>

                        Abstractions hide details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or
